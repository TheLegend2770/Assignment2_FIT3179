            <h3>History of Cheese</h3>
                <p>
                    Cheese making can be traced back almost 10,000 years ago, with 
                    evidence of countries developing cheese in their own ways.  All countries
                    have cheeses unique to their regions.  The famous Green County Cheese factory in
                    is known to produce 200 different types of cheese. 
                    (National Historic Cheese Making Center, https://nationalhistoriccheesemakingcenter.org/history-of-cheese/)
                    <br> <br>Cheese is a staple food used around the world.  It's a 
                    food that even has competitions based on it, in which countries compete 
                    to decide who produces the best cheese.  Are there some countires that 
                    are better at making cheeses than others, and if so what are the 
                    possible reasons for this cheese making predisposition.
                    <br> <br>The table highlights that majority of the countries that produce high
                    quality cheeses are mostly European.  This correlates with the map, that 
                    shows a high level of milk consumption within Europe.  This suggests
                    that the level of a countries milk consumption correlates to the quality 
                    of the cheese they produce.

                <p>
                    The map varying levels of milk consumption around the world.  I can be seen that 
                    the not all areas drink a similar amoun tof milk, with European countries having
                    a larger level compared to the rest of the world.  It is possible that their increased consumption
                    of milk has given them a better understanding in the nuances of cheese making.  This is supported by how
                    African countries have not received any cheese making medals, and have a very low level of milk drinking in the 
                    continent.
